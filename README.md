## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this portfolio.

## Presentation

I am Émeric. Passionate about the web and new technologies in general, I am tech savvy, outgoing and, above all, willing to roll up my sleeves to get things done in a rapidly changing environment. My goal? Working with great people on great projects. I am currently working as Developer Front/End at [La Compagnie Hyperactive](https://www.compagnie-hyperactive.com/) and  [IDAIA](https://www.idaia.group/fr/). Being a true creative, I am really big on design. That, is what fuels my passion for my job: “Bring life to the web design”.

**Always tuned to the market, I am looking for new challenges and opportunities for collaboration!** 🚀
